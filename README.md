# WebApp Dashboard

This project was Project #7 as part of the Treehouse Front End Web Development Techdegree. In this project, I created a web application featuring a dashboard that displays several widgets, including interactive graphs that utilize the chart.js library. I completed this project using HTML, CSS, Sass, both grid and flexbox layout techniques, JavaScript, jQuery, and local storage that saves user preferences from the settings widget. The web application is optimzed for viewing at mobile (320px), tablet (768px) and large (1024px) screens.
